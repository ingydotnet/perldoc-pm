  title: Math is *Hard*
  description: |
    As *Arithmetic Barbie* has taught us: "{/Math is Hard!/}".
    `Math::Barbie` changes all that. It makes doing math as easy as
    pulling a string.
  synopsis: |2
        use Math::Barbie;
    
        print "2 + 4 = ", add(2, 4);
        print "2 / 4 = ", divide(2, 4);

  bugs: |
    Math::Barbie currently only supports half of the mathematical functions.
    `subtract` and ``multiply` are /coming real soon now/.
